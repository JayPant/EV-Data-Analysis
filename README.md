# Electric Vehicle Analysis Project

## Overview
This project conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an electric vehicle (EV) dataset to uncover insights into the electric vehicle market. The primary focus is to analyze trends in electric vehicle adoption, identify popular manufacturers and models, and visualize the geographic distribution of EVs across various states and cities.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in the electric vehicle market based on make, model, and type.
- Examine the relationship between electric vehicle attributes, such as electric range and manufacturer.
- Investigate the geographic distribution of electric vehicles using choropleth maps.
- Assess the distribution of electric vehicles across different states and cities.
- Explore the implications of battery capacity and electric range on vehicle performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **VIN**: Unique Vehicle Identification Number.
- **County, City, State, Postal Code**: Geographic identifiers for vehicle registration.
- **Model Year**: The year the vehicle model was released.
- **Make**: Manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **Model**: Specific model name of the vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Classification of the vehicle, such as Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- **Electric Range**: Maximum distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge.
- **Base MSRP**: Manufacturer's suggested retail price.
- **Electric Utility**: Utility provider associated with the vehicle's location.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Filter and clean the dataset to focus on relevant electric vehicle types.
   - Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Create visualizations to analyze the distribution of electric vehicle types, makes, and models.
   - Generate choropleth maps to visualize the geographic distribution of electric vehicles by state and city.
   - Explore the relationships between vehicle attributes, such as electric range and make.

## Installation
